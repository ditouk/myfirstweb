        <p>My name is Facundo Mendia, I originally come from South America, from a landlock country called Bolivia. This country has different weather as it is close to the Andes Mountains so there are lowlands ans highlands. In the other side is The Amazon Basin (Amazonia) is covered by the largest tropical rain forest in the world, and running through its heart is the Amazon River and its more than 1,000 tributaries, seven of them more than 1,000 miles in length. Measurable rain falls on an average of 200 days a year here, and total rainfall often approaches 100 inches per year. So this is the reason in the city (Sanat Cruz de la Sierra) I grew up is humid. </p>
